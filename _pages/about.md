Hi! I am a PhD candidate at [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/graduate-student/xinyi-wang/) at University of Pennsylvania. My research interests are at the intersection of health, brain, and behavior. I am interested in (1) understanding ways to enhance curiosity towards accurate health information, particularly for vulnerable populations who are most at risk for misperceptions and (2) leveraging intensive-longitudinal and neuroscientific methodologies to understand broader health behavior and well-being.
