Hi! I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow (NIH U01 project: Communication Messaging about the Continuum of Risk for Tobacco Products) at the [Health Communication & Equity Lab](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/health-communication-and-equity-lab) at [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/graduate-student/xinyi-wang/) at the University of Pennsylvania.<br>
My research focuses on (1) curiosity and ways to enhance curiosity towards accurate health information (2) the dynamic interplay between internal processes (e.g., within-person fluctuations of emotions and cognitions) and external influences (e.g., social influence, social relationships) in health behavior.<br> 
I leverage intensive-longitudinal, neuroscientific, and computational methodologies to understand these questions.<br>
