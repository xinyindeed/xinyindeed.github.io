Hi! I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Health Communication & Equity Lab](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/health-communication-and-equity-lab) for a NIH U01 funded project at [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/graduate-student/xinyi-wang/) at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests are at the intersection of health, brain, and behavior. My research focuses on (1) curiosity and ways to enhance curiosity towards accurate health information (2) the dynamic interplay between internal processes (e.g., within-person fluctuations of emotions and cognitions) and external influences (e.g., social influence, social relationships) in health behavior. I leverage intensive-longitudinal, neuroscientific, and computational methodologies to understand these questions.
