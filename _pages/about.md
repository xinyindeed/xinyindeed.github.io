Hi! I am a PhD candidate at [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/graduate-student/xinyi-wang/) at University of Pennsylvania. My research interests are at the intersection of health, brain, and behavior. I am interested in (1) understanding ways to enhance curiosity towards accurate health information, particularly for vulnerable populations who are most at risk for misperceptions and (2) leveraging intensive-longitudinal and neuroscientific methodologies to understand broader health behavior and well-being.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
